    The Postman API enables you to programmatically access data stored in your Postman account.

    > Certain endpoints may be unavailable depending on your region and/or Postman plan. 
      

    ## Getting started

    You can get started with the Postman API by [forking the Postman API collection](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-elements/) to your workspace. You can also click **Run in Postman** to fork the collection and get started:  
    [<img src="https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg">](https://god.gw.postman.com/run-collection/12959542-c8142d51-e97c-46b6-bd77-52bb66712c9a?action=collection%2Ffork&source=rip_markdown&collection-url=entityId%3D12959542-c8142d51-e97c-46b6-bd77-52bb66712c9a%26entityType%3Dcollection%26workspaceId%3D405e0480-49cf-463b-8052-6c0d05a8e8f3)Once you've forked the collection, you can use Postman to send requests.

    ### EU users

    For users in the EU with [<b>Enterprise</b> plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing/), the Postman API uses the `https://api.eu.postman.com` subdomain. Included in this collection is an **euUrl** variable that contains the EU-specific subdomain. To use it, update the **baseUrl** value with the `https://api.eu.postman.com` subdomain.

    ## About the Postman API

    - You must use a valid API Key to send requests to the API endpoints.
        
    - The API has [rate and usage limits](https://learning.postman.com/docs/developer/postman-api/postman-api-rate-limits/).
        
    - The API only responds to HTTPS-secured communications. Any requests sent via HTTP return an HTTP `301` redirect to the corresponding HTTPS resources.
        
    - The API returns requests responses in [JSON format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON).
        
    - The request method (verb) determines the nature of action you intend to perform. A request made using the `GET` method implies that you want to fetch something from Postman. The `POST` method implies you want to save something new to Postman.
        
    - For all requests, API calls respond with their corresponding [HTTP status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes). In the Postman client, the status code also provides help text that details the possible meaning of the response code.
        
    - When calling the API Builder endpoints, you must send an `Accept` header with the `application/vnd.api.v10+json` value.
        

    ### IDs and UIDs

    All items in Postman, such as collections, workspaces, and APIs, have IDs and UIDs:

    - An ID is the unique ID assigned to a Postman item. For example, `ec29121c-5203-409f-9e84-e83ffc10f226`.
        
    - The UID is the **full** ID of a Postman item. This value is the item's unique ID concatenated with the user ID. For example, in the `12345678-ec29121c-5203-409f-9e84-e83ffc10f226` UID:
        
        - `12345678` is the user's ID.
            
        - `ec29121c-5203-409f-9e84-e83ffc10f226` is the item's ID.
            

    ### Enum values

    Any documented enum values should be considered partial lists and may change over time.

    ### 503 response

    An HTTP `503 Service Unavailable` response from our servers indicates there is an unexpected spike in API access traffic. The server is usually operational within the next five minutes. If the outage persists or you receive any other form of an HTTP `5XX` error, [contact support](https://support.postman.com/hc/en-us/requests/new/).

    ### 403 response for unavailable features

    Depending on your region and/or Postman [plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/), some endpoints will return an HTTP `403 Forbidden` response with the "This feature isn't available in your region." detail.

    ## Authentication

    Postman uses API keys for authentication. The API key tells the API server that the request came from you. Everything that you have access to in Postman is accessible with your API key. You can [generate](https://learning.postman.com/docs/developer/postman-api/authentication/#generate-a-postman-api-key) a Postman API key in the [<b>API keys</b>](https://postman.postman.co/settings/me/api-keys) section of your Postman account settings.

    You must include an API key in each request to the Postman API with the `X-API-Key` request header. In Postman, you can store your API key as a [vault secret](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/postman-vault/postman-vault-secrets/) or an [environment variable](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/environments). The Postman API [collection](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/collections) will use it to make API calls.

    ### SCIM authentication

    While all other endpoints in this collection require a Postman API key, the SCIM endpoints require a [SCIM API key](https://learning.postman.com/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/scim-provisioning-overview/#generating-scim-api-key).

    ### Authentication error response

    If an API key is missing, malformed, or invalid, you will receive an HTTP `401 Unauthorized` response code.

    ## Rate and usage limits

    API access [rate limits](https://learning.postman.com/docs/developer/postman-api/postman-api-rate-limits/) apply at a per-user basis in unit time. The limit is **300 requests per minute**. Postman Monitors, as well as the GET `/collections`, GET `/workspaces`, and GET `/workspaces/{id}` endpoints have a rate limit of **10 calls in 10 seconds**.

    Depending on your [plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/), you may also have [usage limits](https://learning.postman.com/docs/billing/resource-usage/). Every API response includes headers to help you identify the status of your use limits. For more information, see [Track Postman API call limits](https://learning.postman.com/docs/developer/postman-api/postman-api-rate-limits/).

    When you reach your rate or usage limits, the API returns the following HTTP `429 Too Many Requests` status code with one of the following error responses:

    - `rateLimited` — Rate limits reached. The response returns the time after which you can resume calls to the Postman API. The response header also includes the `X-RateLimit-RetryAfter` and `Retry-After` responses when you go over your limit, which returns the seconds remaining until you can make another request.
        
    - `serviceLimitExhausted` — Postman API service limits reached. You will need to contact your Postman Team Admin for assistance.

            A comma-separated list of one or more of the following additional resources to include in the response. Use this parameter to query for element links to the API, such as collections and schemas:
            - `collections` — Query for linked Postman collections.
            - `versions` — Query for linked versions.
            - `schemas` — Query for linked schemas.
            - `gitInfo` — Query for information about the API’s git-linked repository. This query only returns the linked repository  and folder locations of the files. It does **not** return `collections` or `schemas` information.

            **Note:**
            API viewers can only use the `versions` option.

        **Note:**

        - Git-connected APIs will **only** return the `versions` and `gitInfo` query responses. This is because schema and collection information is stored in the connected Git repository. The `gitInfo` object only lists the repository and folder locations of the files.
        - API viewers can only use the `versions` option in the `include` query parameter.

        - You can get a collection published in an API version with the `versionId` query parameter.
            
        - The `versionId` query parameter is a **required** parameter for API viewers.

        Gets information about API schema. You can use the `versionId` query parameter to get a schema published in an API version.

        You can use this API to do the following:

        - Get a schema's metadata.
        - Get all the files in a schema. This only returns the first file in the schema. The endpoint response contains a link to the next set of response results.
        - Get a schema's contents in multi-file or bundled format.
            

        **Note:**

        The `versionId` query parameter is a **required** parameter for API viewers.

        **Note:**

        - If the provided file path exists, the file is updated with the new contents.
            
        - If the provided file path does <u>not</u> exist, then a new schema file is created.
            
        - If the file path contains a `/` (forward slash) character, then a folder is created. For example, if the file path is the `dir/schema.json` value, then a `dir` folder is created with the `schema.json` file inside.
            
        - You can only update the `root` tag for protobuf specifications.

        Creates a new API version asynchronously and immediately returns an HTTP `202 Accepted` response. The response contains a polling link to the task status API in the `Location` header.

        This endpoint is equivalent to publishing a version in Postman app, which is the snapshot of API collections and schema at a given point in time.

        Include the following properties in the request body:

        - `name` — A **string** value that contains the version name.
            
        - `collections` — An **array** containing the collection unique IDs to publish.
            
        - `schemas` — An **array** containing the schema IDs to publish.
            
        - `branch` — A **string** value that contains the name of the repository branch. This property is required only for Git-linked APIs.
            

        You can include the following optional properties:

        - `releaseNotes` — A **string** value that contains the Markdown-supported version summary.

        Creates a new relation for an API version. Include the following in the request body:

        - `relationType` — An **array** that contains entity relations. The key value for this array must be the `unclassified` value.
            

        You must include the following properties in the `relationType` array:

        - `entityId` — The collection's UID value.
            

        **Note:**

        The following is **deprecated** in Postman API v10 and higher:

        | **`relationType`** | **`entityId`** |
        | --- | --- |
        | `documentation` and `test` | A collection UID value. |
        | `environment` | An environment UID value. |
        | `mock` | A mock ID value. |
        | `monitor` | A monitor ID value. |

        The endpoint accepts multiple `relationType` arrays in a single call. For an example, see the example response documentation.

        The `documentation` and `test` values returned in the response are the relation ID values, **not** the collection ID values.

        [Merges](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-elements/#merge-changes-from-a-fork) a forked (source) collection and its parent (destination) collection asynchronously. To pull changes into a fork, pass the forked collection's ID as the `destination` value and the parent collection ID as the `source` value.

        The response returns a task `id` value, which you can use to track the merge's status with the GET `/collection-merges-tasks/{taskId}` endpoint.

        Include the following in the request body:

        - `strategy` — A **string** that contains one of the following merge strategies:
            
            - `default` — Make no changes to the fork. You must have **Editor** access to the destination collection.
                
            - `updateSourceWithDestination` — Merge changes and apply any differences in the destination collection to the source. You must have **Editor** access to both the source and destination collection.
                
            - `deleteSource` — Merge the changes and delete the fork. You must have **Editor** access to both the source and destination collection.
                
        - `source` — A **string** value that contains the the forked collection's unique ID.
            
        - `destination` — A **string** value that contains the destination collection's unique ID.

        Gets all of your [collections](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/collections). The response includes all of your subscribed collections.

        **Note:**

        - It's recommended that you use pagination with this endpoint. Pagination improves endpoint performance. Unpaginated calls are considered deprecated and are subject to change.
            
        - Filtering with the `name` parameter when you also pass the `limit` and `offset` parameters is not supported.
            
        - If you do not include the `workspace` query parameter, this endpoint searches all collections in your team’s workspace. If there are a lot of results, this will return a timeout error.

        **This endpoint is deprecated.**

        Merges a forked collection back into its parent collection. You must have the [Editor role](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#collection-roles) for the collection to merge a fork.

        Include the following required properties in the request body:

        - `source` — A **string** value that contains the source collection's unique ID.
            
        - `destination` — A **string** value that contains the destination (parent) collection's unique ID.
            

        You can also include the following optional properties in the request body:

        - `strategy` — A **string** value that contains the fork's merge strategy. One of:
            
            - `deleteSource` — Merge the changes into the parent collection. After the merge process is complete, Postman deletes the fork. You must have Editor access to both the parent and forked collections.
                
            - `updateSourceWithDestination` — (Default) Merge the changes into the parent collection. Any differences in the parent collection are also made to the fork.

        Replaces the contents of a collection. Include the collection's ID values in the request body. If you do not, the endpoint removes the existing items and creates new items.

        > The maximum collection size this endpoint accepts cannot exceed 100 MB. 
          

        For a complete list of properties and information, see the [Postman Collection Format documentation](https://schema.postman.com/collection/json/v2.1.0/draft-07/docs/index.html).

        For protocol profile behavior, refer to Postman's [Protocol Profile Behavior](https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-runtime/blob/develop/docs/protocol-profile-behavior.md) documentation.

        **Note:**

        - This request uses example values in the request body for context when replacing a collection's data. For additional ways to replace collection data, see the collection's examples.
            
        - If you don't include the collection items' ID values from the request body, the endpoint **removes** the existing items and recreates the items with new ID values.
            
        - To copy another collection's contents to the given collection, remove all ID values before you pass it in this endpoint. If you do not, this endpoint returns an error. These values include the `id`, `uid`, and `postman_id` values.

        Creates a folder in a collection. For a complete list of properties and information, see the [Postman Collection Format documentation](https://schema.postman.com/collection/json/v2.1.0/draft-07/docs/index.html).

        You can use this endpoint to to import requests and responses into a newly-created folder. To do this, include the `requests` field and the list of request objects in the request body. For more information, see the provided examples.

        **Note:**

        - This request uses example values in the request body for context when creating collection folders. For additional ways to create a folder, see the collection's examples.
            
        - It is recommended that you pass the `name` property in the request body. If you do not, the system uses a null value. As a result, this creates a folder with a blank name.

        Updates a folder in a collection. For a complete list of properties and information, see the [Postman Collection Format documentation](https://schema.postman.com/collection/json/v2.1.0/draft-07/docs/index.html).

        **Note:**

        - This request uses example values in the request body for context when updating collection folders. For additional ways to update a folder, see the collection's examples.
            
        - This endpoint acts like a PATCH method. It only updates the values that you pass in the request body (for example, the `name` property). The endpoint does **not** update the entire resource.

        Creates a request in a collection. For a complete list of properties and information, see the [Postman Collection Format documentation](https://schema.postman.com/collection/json/v2.1.0/draft-07/docs/index.html).

        **Note:**

        - This request uses example values in the request body for context when creating detailed collection requests. For additional ways to create a request, see the collection's examples.
            
        - It is recommended to include at least the `name` property in the request to avoid creating a request with a blank name.

        Updates a request in a collection. For a complete list of properties and information, see the [Postman Collection Format documentation](https://schema.postman.com/collection/json/v2.1.0/draft-07/docs/index.html).

        **Note:**

        - This request uses example values in the request body for context when updating collection requests. For additional ways to create a request, see the collection's examples.
            
        - You must pass a collection ID (`12ece9e1-2abf-4edc-8e34-de66e74114d2`), not a collection UID (`12345678-12ece9e1-2abf-4edc-8e34-de66e74114d2`), in this endpoint.
            
        - This endpoint acts like a PATCH method. It only updates the values that you pass in the request body (for example, the `name` property). The endpoint does **not** update the entire resource.
            
        - This endpoint does not support changing the folder of a request.

                  **Note:**

                  It is recommended that you pass the `name` property in the request body. If you do not, the system uses a null value. As a result, this creates a response with a blank name.

        Creates a request response in a collection. For a complete list of properties and information, see the [Postman Collection Format documentation](https://schema.postman.com/collection/json/v2.1.0/draft-07/docs/index.html).

        **Note:**

        - This request uses example values in the request body for context when creating detailed collection responses. For additional ways to create a response, see the collection's examples.
            
        - It is recommended that you pass the `name` property in the request body. If you do not, the system uses a null value. As a result, this creates a response with a blank name.

                  Information about the response. For a complete list of properties, refer to the **Response** entry in the [Postman Collection Format documentation](https://schema.postman.com/collection/json/v2.1.0/draft-07/docs/index.html).

                  **Note:**

                  It is recommended that you pass the `name` property in the request body. If you do not, the system uses a null value. As a result, this creates a response with a blank name.

        Updates a response in a collection. For a complete list of properties and information, see the [Postman Collection Format documentation](https://schema.postman.com/collection/json/v2.1.0/draft-07/docs/index.html).

        **Note:**

        - This request uses example values in the request body for context when updating collection responses. For additional ways to create a response, see the collection's examples.
            
        - You must pass a collection ID (`12ece9e1-2abf-4edc-8e34-de66e74114d2`), not a collection UID (`12345678-12ece9e1-2abf-4edc-8e34-de66e74114d2`), in this endpoint.
            
        - This endpoint acts like a PATCH method. It only updates the values that you pass in the request body (for example, the `name` property). The endpoint does **not** update the entire resource.

        - Secret Scanner
        - Detected Secrets
      description: |-
        Returns all secrets detected by Postman's [Secret Scanner](https://learning.postman.com/docs/administration/secret-scanner/), grouped by workspace or resource. If you pass an empty request body, this endpoint returns all results.

        You can include the following properties in the request body:

        - `secretTypes` — An **array** that contains a list of secrets types to query. For a list of valid IDs, use the GET `/secret-types` endpoint.
            
        - `resolved` — A **boolean** value that, if true, return secrets with a `resolved` status.
            
        - `statuses` — An **array** that contains a list of the secret resolution status type:
            
            - `FALSE_POSITIVE` — The discovered secret is not an actual secret.
                
            - `REVOKED` — The secret is valid, but the user rotated their key to resolve the issue.
                
            - `ACCEPTED_RISK` — The Secret Scanner found the secret, but user accepts the risk of publishing it.
                
        - `resources` — An **array of objects** that contains a list of resources to query:
            
            - `type` — The type of resource:
                
                - `collection`
                    
                - `environment`
                    
                - `extensible-collection`
                    
                - `globals`
                    
                - `example`
                    
                - `request`
                    
                - `folder`
                    
                - `extensible-collection-meta`

                - `extensible-folder`
                    
                - `extensible-example`
                    
                - `extensible-message`
                    
                - `api-definition-file`
                    
                - `api-definition`
                    
            - `ids` — An **array of string** containing the element IDs to search.
                
        - `workspaceIds` — An **array** that contains a list of workspaces IDs to query.
            
        - `workspaceVisibilities` — An **array** that contains a list of workspace [visibility settings](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/managing-workspaces/#changing-workspace-visibility) to query. This currently supports the `team` and `public` settings.
            

        **Note:**

        The `workspaceIds` and `resources` properties are mutually exclusive. You can only use one in a request. If you pass both, the API returns an HTTP 400 `Bad Request` response.

        Updates specific environment properties, such as its name and variables.

        **Note:**

        - You can only perform one type of operation at a time. For example, you cannot perform an `add` and `replace` operation in the same call.
            
        - The request body size cannot exceed the maximum allowed size of 30MB.
            
        - If you receive an HTTP `411 Length Required` error response, manually pass the `Content-Length` header and its value in the request header.
            
        - To add a description to an existing variable, use the `add` operation.

        Gets a mock server's call logs. You can get a maximum of 6.5MB of call logs or a total of 100 call logs, whichever limit is met first in one API call.

        Call logs contain exchanged request and response data made to mock servers. The logs provide visibility into how the mock servers are being used. You can log data to debug, test, analyze, and more, depending upon the use case.

        **Note:**

        Call logs have a retention period based on your [Postman plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/#mock-calls).

        Creates a server response. Server responses let you simulate 5xx server-level responses, such as 500 or 503.

        Server-level responses are agnostic to application-level logic. Server responses let you simulate this behavior on a mock server. You do not need to define each error for all exposed paths on the mock server.

        If you set a server response as active, then all the calls to the mock server return with that active server response.

        **Note:**

        You can create multiple server responses for a mock server, but only one mock server can be set as active.

        You must include the following properties in the request body:

        - `name` — A **string** value that contains the server response's name.
            
        - `statusCode` — An **integer** value that contains the server stub's 5xx response code. This property only accepts [5xx values](https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/http-status-codes.xhtml).
            

        You can also include the following optional properties:

        - `headers` — An **array of objects** that contains the server stub's headers:
            
            - `key` — A **string** value that contains the header's key.
                
            - `value` — A **string** value that contains the header key's value. This value defines the corresponding value for the header key.
                
        - `body` — A **string** value that contains a response body that returns when you call the mock server.

        Runs a monitor and returns its run results.

        **Note:**

        - If you pass the `async=true` query parameter, the response does not return the `stats`, `executions`, and `failures` responses. To get this information for an asynchronous run, call the [GET](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-public-workspace/request/12959542-e4167234-9a55-4b15-8146-0487978d952f?ctx=documentation&tab=overview) `/monitors/{id}` endpoint.
            
        - If the call exceeds 300 seconds, the endpoint returns an HTTP `202 Accepted` response. Use the [GET](https://www.postman.com/postman/postman-public-workspace/request/7izaj6c/get-a-monitor) `/monitors/{id}` endpoint to check the run's status in the response's `lastRun` property. To avoid this, it is recommended that you include the `async=true` query parameter when using this endpoint.

        Gets information about the folders and elements added to your team's [Private API Network](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/adding-private-network/). Elements are APIs, collections, and workspaces.

        **Note:**

        The `limit` and `offset` parameters are separately applied to elements and folders. For example, if you query a `limit` value of `10` and an `offset` value `0`, the endpoint returns 10 elements and 10 folders for a total of 20 items. The `totalCount` property in the `meta` response is the total count of **both** elements and folders.

        Publishes a element or creates a folder in your team's [Private API Network](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/adding-private-network/). An element is a Postman API, collection, or workspace.

        In the `elementType` object, include the following values:

        **For APIs and Workspaces:**

        - `id` — A **string** value that contains the element's ID.
            
        - `parentFolderId` — An **integer** value that contains the element's parent folder ID.
            

        **For Collections:**

        - `id` — A **string** value that contains the collection's UID (`userId`\-`collectionId`).
            
        - `parentFolderId` — An **integer** value that contains the collection's parent folder ID.
            
        - `environments` — An **array of strings** that contains environment UIDs (`userId`\-`environmentId`).
            

        **For Private API Network Folders:**

        - `name` — A **string** value that contains the folder's name.
            
        - `description` — A **string** value that contains the folder's description.
            
        - `parentFolderId` — An **integer** value that contains the folder's parent folder ID. To create a folder at the root level, omit this property from the request body.

        Updates an element or folder in your team's [Private API Network](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/adding-private-network/). When you call this endpoint, the `elementType` property must be the `api`, `folder`, `collection`, or `workspace` value.

        The `elementId` value is the `api`, `folder`, or `workspace` element's ID. For `collection`, this value is the collection's UID (`userId`\-`collectionId`).

        Include the following in the request body object:

        - `elementType` — The Private API Network element type. The object's name must be one of the following:
            - `api`
                
            - `folder`
                
            - `collection`
                
            - `workspace`
                

        In the `elementType` object, include the following values:

        - `parentFolderId` — A **string** value that contains the element's new Private API Network folder ID.
            

        **For Collections:**

        - `summary` — A **string** value that contains the collection's new summary.
            

        **For Private API Network Folders:**

        You can include the following optional properties:

        - `description` — A **string** value that contains the folder's new description.
            
        - `name` — A **string** value that contains the folder's new name.

        Creates a new user group in Postman and creates a new account for each group member.

        Each account is added to your Postman team and authentication is activated for each user. If an existing Postman account uses an email that matches a group member's email ID, an [email invite](https://postman.postman.co/docs/administration/managing-your-team/managing-your-team/#invites) to join your Postman team is sent to that user. Once the user accepts the invite, they'll be added to your team.

        By default, the system assigns new users the developer role. You can [update user roles in Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/administration/managing-your-team/managing-your-team/#managing-team-roles).

        Creates a new user account in Postman and adds the user to your organization's Postman team.

        - If the account does not exist, this also activates the user so they can authenticate in to your Postman team.
            
        - If an account matching the email ID exists, the user receives [email invite](https://learning.postman.com/docs/administration/managing-your-team/manage-team-members/#manage-invites) to join the Postman team. The user joins the team when they accept the invite.
            
        - If the user's email domain matches your team's verified domains, the user is immediately added to the team.
            

        By default, the system assigns new users the developer role. You can [update user roles in Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/administration/managing-your-team/manage-team-members/#manage-team-roles).

        **Note:**

        - Users must join the team before you can assign them to any groups.
            
        - If the user is a member of a different team during SCIM provisioning and their email domain is **not** verified with your Postman team, then the user is **not** provisioned. The endpoint returns an HTTP `409 Conflict` response.

        - `schemas` — An **array** that contains the `urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User` value.
            
        - `userName` — A **string** value that contains the new user email address. The address must be a verified domain.
            
        - `name` — An **object** that contains the user's `givenName` (first name) and `familyName` (last name).
            
        - `active` — A **boolean** value set to one of the following values:
            
            - `true` — Activates the user. This lets them authenticate in to your Postman team.
                
            - `false` — Removes the user from your Postman team and deactivates the account. This blocks the user from authenticating in to Postman.
                

        ### Reactivating users

        By setting the `active` property from `false` to `true`, this reactivates an account. This allows the account to authenticate in to Postman and adds the account back on to your Postman team.

        Updates a user in Postman.

        When updating the user's `active` state, include the following in the `Operations` array of objects:

        - `op` — A **string** value that contains the operation to perform. Accepts `replace`.
            
        - `value` — An **object** that contains the following:
            
            - `active` — A **boolean** value set to one of the following values:
                
                - `true` — Activates the user. This lets them authenticate in to your Postman team.
                    
                - `false` — Removes the user from your Postman team and deactivates the account. This blocks the user from authenticating in to Postman.
                    

        When updating a username, include the following in the `Operations` array of objects:

        - `op` — A **string** value that contains the operation to perform. Accepts `replace`.
            
        - `path` — A **string** that contains the `userName` value.
            
        - `value` — A **string** value that contains the new username (email address). The address must be a verified domain.
            

        ### Reactivating users

        By setting the `active` property from `false` to `true`, this reactivates an account. This allows the account to authenticate in to Postman and adds the account back on to your Postman team.

        Creates an API specification file.

        **Note:**

        - If the file path contains a `/` (forward slash) character, then a folder is created. For example, if the path is the `components/schemas.json` value, then a `components` folder is created with the `schemas.json` file inside.
            
        - Creating a spec file assigns it the `DEFAULT` file type.
            
        - Multi-file specifications can only have one root file.
            
        - Files cannot exceed a maximum of 10 MB in size.

        Updates an API specification's file.

        **Note:**

        - This endpoint does not accept an empty request body. You must pass one of the accepted values.
            
        - This endpoint does not accept multiple request body properties in a single call. For example, you cannot pass both the `content` and `type` property at the same time.
            
        - Multi-file specifications can only have one root file.
            
        - When updating a file type to `ROOT`, the previous root file is updated to the `DEFAULT` file type.
            
        - Files cannot exceed a maximum of 10 MB in size.

                    The type of file:
                    - `ROOT` — The file containing the full OpenAPI structure. This serves as the entry point for the API spec and references other (`DEFAULT`) spec files. Multi-file specs can only have one root file. 
                    - `DEFAULT` — A file referenced by the `ROOT` file.
            example:
              content: '{{fileContent}}'
